  <h3>Guidelines for Writing Use Cases</h3>
  
  <ul>
   <li>Capture the user's intention, not the details of a particular
   UI.</li>
  
   <li>Each use case should show the user succeeding at a goal.  Any
   type of failure or error should be handled as an alternative.</li>
  
   <li>If one use case has too many steps or extensions, split it into
   two use cases.  Use the "perform" notation to refer to shared steps.</li>
  
   <li>If it is not already clear from context, you may want to number
   the steps of an extension to indicate the point in the main use case
   steps where the extension starts.</li>
  
   <li>The actor, frequency, and use case name should fit into this
   sentence, both logically and grammatically: "An ACTOR will FREQ want
   to USE-CASE-NAME."  If the frequency is "Once", scope the timeframe:
   e.g., once per user, or once per customer, or once per installation.
   </li>
  
   <li>If a use case has more than about 9 steps, you are probably
   showing too much detail (or the task will be really hard to
   perform).</li>
  
   <li>Evaluate the usefulness and usability of your system by
   evaluating the use cases before going further with design or
   implementation.  See the <a
   href="http://readyset.tigris.org/words-of-wisdom/use-case-format.html">words
   of wisdom</a> for links to evaluation techniques.</li>
  
   <li>One good evaluation technique is the cognitive walkthrough.  At
   each step think of a confident answer to these questions:
    <ul>
     <li>Would the user realize that they should do that step?</li>
     <li>Would the user recognize the proper button to press?</li>
     <li>Would the user be able to provide the needed information?</li>
     <li>Does the system provide an indication that the user's action
       succeeded?</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  
  </ul>
