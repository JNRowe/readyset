 <h4>Feature specification guidelines</h4>
 <dl>

  <dt>The feature set should provide all the benefits claimed in the
  <a href="../templates/target-and-benefits.html">target and
  benefits</a> document.</dt>

  <dd>Features actually <strong>support</strong> users in achiving a
  claimed benefit when the feature replaces some of the work that a
  human would otherwise do manually.  E.g., a spreadsheet supports
  users who need to calculate totals and produce simple charts.</dd>

  <dd>Features <strong>allow</strong> users to achive a claimed
  benefit when they make it easier for a human user to do a task, even
  if that task is still largely up to the user.  E.g., a spreadsheet
  allows users to make business decisions based on totals and charts,
  but the decisions are completely the users' responsibility: the
  spreadsheet itself does not implement logic for any one particular
  business decision.</dd>



  <dt>Features should be described precisely enough to guide
  implementation.</dt>

  <dd>Each feature should be written in enough detail that a new
  developer could join the team and implement the feature without
  needing too much explanation.</dd>

  <dd>If only developers who already have extensive background
  knowledge of the discussions leading up to this document would be
  able to understand the feature, then it should be described more
  clearly and precisely by taking some of these steps:
 
    <ul>
     <li>Precisely define valid inputs, and error handling</li>
     <li>Specify data structures with UML or logical schema</li>
     <li>Specify UI aspects of features with tiny mockups</li>
     <li>Specify key decisions with decision trees or tables</li>
     <li>Specify key algorithms with pseudo-code or flow charts</li>
     <li>Specify state-based behavior with state machines or tables</li>
     <li>Specify sequences of events with scenario diagrams</li>
   </ul>

 <h4>Tips on Managing Feature Risk</h4>

<ul>

 <li>If you have features that are high priority, high effort, and
 high risk, you should go back to the drawing board to change what you
 are trying to do, break those features down into more manageable
 parts, or add more time or resources.</li>

 <li>High risk means more effort, because effort must be put into
 assessment and mitigation of risk factors up front.  Some of the risk
 factors will not turn out in your favor, so you will need to put in
 additional effort for rework and re-planning.</li>

 <li>Many risks arise from missing information.  The simplest way to
 address these is to ask someone who knows or look it up.  E.g., does a
 particular software component work with internationalized character
 sets?</li>

 <li>Many computer science issues of algorithms and data structure
 capacity and performance can be worked out mathematically.  Although
 these do not give precise performance measures, they can determine
 the difference between a useful approach and a hopeless approach.
 E.g., we are storing catalog item descriptions in a flat file, the
 time it takes to update that file grows linearly with the number of
 catalog items, which will be hopelessly slow in practice.  E.g., our
 Java applet will be about 260KB in size, how long will that take to
 download over a 56Kbps modem?</li>

 <li>A feasibility study is often an exercise in building a small
 prototype to demonstrate and test some risky aspect of the system.
 For example, do the web browsers that we want to support properly
 handle the CSS or JavaScript features that we plan to use?  E.g., can
 the database work reliably when its files are stored on a different
 file server?</li>
