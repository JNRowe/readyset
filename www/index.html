 <dl>
  <dt>What problem does this project address?</dt>

  <dd>Software development projects require a lot of "paperwork" in
  the form of requirements documents, design documents, test plans,
  schedules, checklists, release notes, etc.  It seems that everyone
  creates the documents from a blank page, from the documents used on
  their last project, or from one of a handful of high-priced
  proprietary software engineering template libraries.  For those of
  us who start from a blank page, it can be a lot of work and it is
  easy to forget important parts.  That is not a very reliable basis
  for professional engineering projects.</dd>

  <dt>What is the goal of this project?</dt>

  <dd>ReadySET is an open source project to produce and maintain a
  library of reusable software engineering document templates.  These
  templates provide a ready starting point for the documents used in
  software development projects.  Using good templates can help
  developers work more quickly, but they also help to prompt
  discussion and avoid oversights.</dd>

 <dt>What are some key features that define the product?</dt>

 <dd>
  <ul>
   <li>High-quality outlines, sample text, and checklists.</li>

   <li>Uses simple web technologies: Pure XHTML and CSS.</li>

   <li>Templates for <i>many</i> common software engineering
   documents.  Including:
    <ul>
     <li>Project proposal template</li>
     <li>Project plan template</li>
     <li>Use case template</li>
     <li>QA plan template</li>
     <li>Several design templates</li>
     <li>System test case template</li>
     <li>Release checklist template</li>
    </ul>
   </li>

  </ul>
 </dd>

 <dt>What makes this product different from others?</dt>

 <dd>This is an open source project that you are welcome to use for
 free and help make better.  Existing packages of software engineering
 templates are highly costly and biased by the authorship of only a
 few people, by vendor-client relationships, or by the set of tools
 offered by a particular vendor.</dd>

 <dd>These templates are in pure XHTML with CSS, not a proprietary
 file format.  That makes them easier to edit and to track changes
 using freely available tools and version control systems.  The
 templates are designed to always be used on the web; they use
 hyperlinks to avoid duplicating information.</dd>

 <dd>The templates are not burdened with information about individual
 authorship or document change history.  It is assumed that
 professional software developers will keep all project documents in
 version control systems that provide those capabilities.</dd>

 <dd>These templates are not one-size-fits-all and they do not attempt
 to provide prescriptive guidance on the overall development process.
 We are developing a broad library of template modules for many
 purposes and processes.  The templates may be filled out in a
 suggested sequence or in any sequence that fits your existing
 process.  They may be easily customized with any text or HTML editor.</dd>


</dl>

 <h3>Scope</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>What is the scope of this project?</dt>

 <dd>
  We will build templates for common software engineering documents
  inspired by our own exprience. 
 </dd>

 <dt>What are the high-level assumptions or ground rules for the project?</dt>

 <dd>
  I assume that the user takes ultimate responsibility for the content
  of all their actual project documents.  The templates are merely
  starting points and low-level guidance.
 </dd>

 <dt>What are we not going to do?</dt>

 <dd>
  This project does not attempt to provide powerful tools
  for reorganizing the templates, mapping them to a given software
  development process, or generating templates from a underlying
  process model.  This project does not include any application code
  for any tools, users simply use text editors to fill in or customize
  the templates.
 </dd>

 <dt>Is this project part of a larger effort?</dt>

 <dd>
  Yes.  It is part of the Tigris.org mission of promoting open source
  software engineering.  It is also the first product in a product
  line that will provide even better support to professional software
  developers.  For more information, see <a
  href="http://www.readysetpro.com">ReadySET&nbsp;Pro</a>.

 <h3>Status</h3>
<dl>
 <dt>What is the status of this project?</dt>
 
 <dd>These templates are based on templates originally used to teach
 software engineering in a university project course.  They are now
 being enhanced, expanded, and used more widely by professionals in
 industry.</dd>

 <dd>The template set is fairly complete and ready for use in real
 projects.  You can <a
 href="http://readyset.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">download</a> recent releases.
 We welcome your feedback.</dd>

<h3>Applicability</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>Who should use this product?</dt>

 <dd>ReadySET is aimed at software engineers who wish that their
 projects could go more smoothly and professionally.  ReadySET can be
 used by anyone who is able to use an HTML editor or edit HTML
 in a text editor.</dd>

 <dt>How can users get started?</dt>

 <dd>
  <ol>
   <li>Briefly <a href="/nonav/templates/frameset.html">browse all templates</a></li>
   <li><a href="http://readyset.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">Download</a> the templates and unarchive</li>
   <li>Edit the templates to fit the needs of your project</li>
   <li>Place the templates on a web server where all your project stakeholders can view them</li>
   <li>Edit the templates to fill in detailed information
    <ul>
     <li>Use a text editor or an HTML editor.  Please see our
         list of <a href="docs/recommended-tools.html">recommended tools</a>.
         (You can use Word, but that is strongly discouraged.)</li>
     <li>Follow instructions that appead in yellow "sticky notes"</li>
     <li>Replace text in ALL CAPS with text that describes your project</li>
     <li>"<a href="docs/faq.html#chipaway">Chip away</a>" text that does not apply to your project</li>
     <li>Add text, diagrams, or links as needed</li>
    </ul>
   </li>

   <li>Use the checklists to catch common errors and improve the
   quality of your documents.</li>

   <li>Use the words-of-wisdom pages to help improve the document or
   deepen your understanding of relevant issues.</li>

   <li>Optionally, you may change fonts and colors in
   the file css/inst.css.</li>

   <li>If you have questions or insights about a templates, please
   read the <a href="docs/faq.html">FAQ</a> or send an email to <a
   href="mailto:dev&#064;readyset.tigris.org"
