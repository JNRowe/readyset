 <h3>Work Breakdown Structure and Estimates</h3>

  TODO: List tasks that will be needed for this project.  Keep
  dividing tasks into subtasks until you feel that you have enough
  detail to expose risks and make reasonable estimates.  
 </div>

 <div class="sticky">
  TIP: Label each step uniquely to show its position in the WBS,
  e.g., Step 1.1.4.A.  Use numbers for steps that you intend to do
  in sequence, and use letters for steps that you intend to do in
  parallel.  E.g., Step 1.1 comes before Steps 1.2.A and 1.2.B, but
  those two steps may be done in parallel, and Step 1.3 will be done
  after all 1.2.* steps have been finished.  Don't worry about
  renumbering if you delete a step.

 <h3>Project Risks</h3>
 <div class="sticky">
  TODO: List and rank the major risks of this project, and what you plan to
  do to mitigate each risk.  If you don't plan to do anything to
  mitigate the risk, state that.
 </div>

 <p>The main risks of this project are:</p>
 <ol class="sample1">
  <li>There is a potential conflict between the goals of a
  high-quality appearance and one that is completely customizable.  We
  can only succeed if players find the web site appealing, and game
  vendors can customize it with no more effort than would be needed to
  build a static website.  We already have a design in mind that will
  address this risk and we will review it with a web site designer who
  worked for a game vendor site.</li>

  <li>There are significant technical difficulties in building a web
  site and web application.  This will be a risk because one person on
  our team has much experience with the relevant tools and
  technologies.  Although the others will learn, we will certainly
  make some mistakes and suboptimal choices.  We will address this
  risk by scoping the project such that we have enough time to train
  and to review the design and implementation.</li>

  <li>The schedule for this project is very short.  We will manage
  this by planning a conservatively scoped functional core and series
  of functional enhancements that can be individually slipped to later
  releases if needed.</li>

  <li>The performance of the system will be significantly impacted by
  the decisions made during the <a href="#3.2.C">database design
  task</a>.  None of our current team members has experience with
  database optimization.  To address this, we will arrange a review
  meeting with an experienced DBA or hire a consultant from the
  database vendor.</li>

  <li>We could be underestimating known tasks. HOW TO AVOID/MITIGATE?</li>

  <li>We could be underestimating the impact of unknown tasks. HOW TO
  AVOID/MITIGATE?</li>

  <li>We could be underestimating the dependencies between tasks. HOW
  TO AVOID/MITIGATE?</li>

  <li>We could have misunderstood the customer's requirements.  HOW TO
  AVOID/MITIGATE?</li>

  <li>The customer could change the requirements.  HOW TO
  AVOID/MITIGATE?</li>

  <li>We could face major difficulties with the technology chosen for
  this project.  HOW TO AVOID/MITIGATE?</li>

  <li>We could have low quality that demands significant rework.  HOW
  TO AVOID/MITIGATE?</li>

  <li>We could incorrectly assess our progress until it is too late to
  react.  HOW TO AVOID/MITIGATE?</li>

  <li>We could lose resources.  E.g., team members could get sick,
  spend time on other projects, or quit.  HOW TO AVOID/MITIGATE?</li>
