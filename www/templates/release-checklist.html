 this release may be sent to manufacturing and sold to customers with
 the full support of the organization.</p>

   its status.  Add comments as needed to record important decisions
   or link to resulting documents.  Add new items as needed for your

   TIP: If a stakeholder hits difficulties with this release after it
   goes out, add those issues to the checklist template so that
   everyone knows that they will be explicitly managed on the next
   release.  Conduct a <a href="postmortem.html">postmortem review</a>
   to help expose difficulties rather than repeat them.
 </div>

 <div class="sticky">
   TIP: You might consider some of the following additional
   stakeholders at your organization: Other engineering groups (i.e.,
   hardware design), Manufacturing and Shipping, Software Process
   Improvement, Key customers and partners, External developers, Risk
   Management, Business Development, and Upper Management.
